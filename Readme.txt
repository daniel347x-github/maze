Welcome to the MazeQuiz!

You are asked here to write some javascript code (your_code.js) to help the player get from the starting point to the end of the maze.

Your code should run through the browser (we recommend using Chrome but other browsers can also be used) by opening the MazeQuiz.html file.

Once you are finished, send the "your_code.js" file to avgoustinos@porizi.com

Feel free to ask any questions or report any problems to avgoustinos@porizi.com

Good luck!
